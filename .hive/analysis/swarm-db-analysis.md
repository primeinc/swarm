### Event Category Distribution

| Category | Event Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Work Item Lifecycle** | 723 | 39.7% |
| **Decision Intelligence** | 159 | 8.7% |
| **Learning System** | 158 | 8.7% |
| **Agent Communication** | 198 | 10.9% |

| **Agent Lifecycle** | 115 | 6.3% |
| **Other** | 135 | 7.4% |

**Key Insights:**
- **Work item lifecycle dominates** (40%) - heavy cell creation/closing
- **Decision intelligence well-captured** (8.7%) - good audit trail
- **Learning system active** (8.7%) - memory storage and retrieval happening
- **Quality control coverage** (6.1%) - reviews started/completed tracked
- **Low swarm completion rate** - 26 started vs 17 completed (65%) suggests some swarms don't finish cleanly

---

## Strategy Usage Breakdown

**Note:** Strategy data extraction from `coordinator_decision` events shows empty results. This suggests:
1. Strategy field may not be consistently populated in event data JSON
2. Strategies may be implicit (not recorded in decisions)
3. Field name may differ from expected `$.strategy` path

**Alternative source:** `eval_records` table shows:
- **feature-based:** 5 records (100% success rate)

**Decision trace analysis:**
- **strategy_selection decisions:** 5 (matches eval_records count)
- Suggests strategy selection happens but isn't captured in standard coordinator_decision events

**Recommendation:** Audit `coordinator_decision` event schema to ensure strategy is captured consistently. Current event payload examples:
```json
{"action":"spawn"}
{"action":"old"}
{"session_id":"...","epic_id":"bd-123","event_type":"DECISION","payload":{"strategy":"file-based"},"decision_type":"strategy_selected"}
```

The `strategy_selected` decision_type appears to be the correct place, but it's a separate decision event, not embedded in all coordinator decisions.

---

## Review Outcomes Analysis

**Source:** `review_completed` events (59 total)

| Review Status | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| `approved` | 38 | 64.4% |
| `needs_changes` | 18 | 30.5% |
| `blocked` | 3 | 5.1% |

**Key Insights:**
- **Healthy approval rate:** 64% first-pass approval
- **Constructive feedback:** 30% need changes (not rejected, just iterated)
- **Minimal blockage:** Only 5% hard-blocked (likely architectural issues)
- **3-strike rule working:** Blocked status suggests multiple rejection cycles

**Comparison to decision traces:**
- 62 `review_decision` traces vs 59 `review_completed` events
- Suggests 3 reviews are still in-flight or weren't completed

---

## Compaction Event Analysis

**Total compaction events:** 83

### Compaction Event Structure

Sample event payload:
```json
{
  "session_id": "test-compaction-1767725432376-0",
  "epic_id": "bd-123",
  "event_type": "COMPACTION",
  "payload": {
    "confidence": "high",
    "context_type": "full",
    "epic_id": "bd-456"
  },
  "compaction_type": "detection_complete"
}
```

**Compaction Types:**
- `detection_complete` - Swarm signature detected
- `prompt_generated` - LLM compaction prompt created

**Issue:** No `prompt_type` field found in database events. All 83 events return NULL for `json_extract(data, '$.prompt_type')`.

**Alternative analysis from log files shows:**
- Compaction prompts ARE being generated (log entries with full prompts)
- Prompt length example: 5,800 characters (repeated coordinator mantra)
- Suggests prompt_type may be in nested structure or log-only

---

## Compaction Log Error Analysis

**Log file:** `~/.config/swarm-tools/logs/compaction.log`  
**Total lines:** 1,768  
**Analysis period:** 2026-01-02 to 2026-01-06

### Error Pattern Summary

| Error Type | Count | Severity |
|------------|-------|----------|
| `ProviderModelNotFoundError` | 6 | Medium |
| `Cannot find module` errors | 2 | High |
| LLM compaction timeouts (30s) | 6 | Medium |

### Detailed Error Patterns

#### 1. ProviderModelNotFoundError (6 occurrences)

**Pattern:**
```
ProviderModelNotFoundError: ProviderModelNotFoundError
data: {
  providerID: "__SWARM_LITE_
```

**Root Cause:** Provider ID prefix `__SWARM_LITE_` is incomplete/malformed.

**Impact:** Compaction prompt generation fails, falls back to default behavior.

**Recommendation:** 
- Audit model provider configuration in swarm plugin
- Ensure `SWARM_LITE` provider is properly registered
- Add validation before attempting LLM calls

#### 2. Module Resolution Errors (2 occurrences)

**Pattern:**
```
error: Cannot find module '@opencode-ai/plugin' from '/Users/joel/.config/opencode/plugin/swarm.ts'
```

**Root Cause:** Plugin wrapper attempting to import from npm package scope.

**Impact:** Complete plugin failure, OpenCode crashes.

**Recommendation:**
- **CRITICAL:** Plugin wrapper MUST be self-contained
- Per AGENTS.md mandate: "Plugin wrapper at `~/.config/opencode/plugin/swarm.ts` must have ZERO imports from `opencode-swarm-plugin`"
- Inline all logic or use CLI spawn pattern

#### 3. LLM Compaction Timeouts (6 occurrences)

**Pattern:**
```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "msg": "generate_compaction_prompt_exception",
  "error": "LLM compaction timeout (30s)",
  "duration_ms": 30002
}
```

**Root Cause:** Compaction prompt generation exceeds 30-second timeout.

**Impact:** Compaction fails, context not compressed, potential context exhaustion.

**Recommendation:**
- Increase timeout to 60s for complex sessions
- Implement streaming compaction for large contexts
- Add compaction quality metrics (prompt length vs output length)

### Success Rate Analysis

**Log message distribution:**

| Message Type | Count | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| `generate_compaction_prompt_llm_complete` | 10 | Successful completions |
| `swarm_state_resolved` | 4 | State recovery successful |
| `generate_compaction_prompt_exception` | 4 | Timeout exceptions |
| `using_projection_as_snapshot` | 3 | Projection-based state |
| `session_scan_complete` | 3 | Session indexed successfully |
| `generate_compaction_prompt_llm_failed` | 1 | Module resolution failure |

**Success Rate:** ~71% (10 successes / 14 attempts)

**Note:** Timeouts don't appear in stderr-based error counts, only in exception logs. True failure rate may be higher.

| `/Users/joel/Code/skillrecordings/migrate-egghead` | 43 | 2.4% |
| `/Users/joel/Code/vercel/academy-scratch` | 26 | 1.4% |
| `/tmp/test-project` | 20 | 1.1% |
| `/var/folders/.../swarm-e2e-*` | 20 | 1.1% |

**Key Insights:**
- **opencode-next dominates** (33%) - main development project
- **Test projects significant** (17%) - heavy integration testing
- **Monorepo sub-packages tracked separately** - may want to consolidate project_key normalization
- **71 other projects** with minimal activity (< 20 events each) - breadcrumbs from various sessions

## Database Health & Recommendations

### Schema Design: ✅ Strong

**Strengths:**
- Event sourcing with proper indexing
- Foreign key constraints where appropriate
- Check constraints for data validity
- Soft deletes (tombstone status, deleted_at fields)
- FTS5 full-text search + vector embeddings for memories
- Decision tracing with rich context capture

**Minor Issues:**
- `cells` view is transitional abstraction - should migrate fully to one name
- `cells` table name conflicts with new "cells" terminology
- `swarm_contexts` low usage (4 records) - may be underutilized

### Data Quality: ⚠️ Good with Gaps

**Strengths:**
- Consistent event capture across categories
- Review outcomes well-tracked
- Decision traces capture rationale and alternatives
- Memory system heavily used

**Gaps:**
- Strategy data not in coordinator_decision events (separate event type)
- `eval_records.overall_success` sparsely populated (5/26)
- Compaction events missing `prompt_type` field in database (log-only?)
- 26 swarm_started vs 17 swarm_completed (9 missing outcomes)

### Performance: ✅ Good

**Index coverage:**
- All foreign keys indexed
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Vector index for semantic search
- FTS5 for full-text search

**Query Performance Notes:**
- JSON extraction queries (`json_extract(data, '$.field')`) may be slow at scale
- Consider materialized columns for frequently-accessed JSON fields (strategy, status, etc.)
- 1,821 events is still small - monitor performance at 10k+ events

### Recommendations

#### 1. Schema Evolution

**Priority: Medium**

```sql
-- Materialize commonly-queried JSON fields
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN event_strategy TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(data, '$.strategy')) STORED;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN event_status TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(data, '$.status')) STORED;

CREATE INDEX idx_events_strategy ON events(event_strategy) WHERE event_strategy IS NOT NULL;
```

**Rationale:** JSON extraction is slow. Generated columns + indexes speed up strategy/status queries.

#### 2. Compaction System Hardening

**Priority: High**

- Fix `__SWARM_LITE_` provider ID issue (audit swarm plugin config)
- Increase timeout from 30s → 60s for compaction LLM calls
- Add compaction metrics table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE compaction_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    input_length INTEGER NOT NULL,
    output_length INTEGER NOT NULL,
    compression_ratio REAL NOT NULL,
    duration_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
    model TEXT,
    success INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
  );
  ```

#### 3. Eval System Completion

**Priority: Medium**

- Populate `overall_success` for all eval records (currently 5/26)
- Add automated eval triggers on swarm completion
- Link eval_records to events table via `outcome_event_id`

#### 4. Swarm Lifecycle Tracking

**Priority: Medium**

**Issue:** 26 swarm_started vs 17 swarm_completed (9 incomplete)

**Investigation needed:**
- Are swarms failing silently?
- Are completion events not being emitted?
- Are some swarms legitimately long-running?

**Recommendation:**
```sql
-- Find swarms with no completion event
SELECT 
  e1.data AS start_event,
  e1.timestamp AS started_at,
  (strftime('%s', 'now') * 1000 - e1.timestamp) / 3600000.0 AS hours_since_start
FROM events e1
WHERE e1.type = 'swarm_started'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM events e2 
    WHERE e2.type IN ('swarm_completed', 'swarm_failed')
      AND json_extract(e1.data, '$.epic_id') = json_extract(e2.data, '$.epic_id')
  )
ORDER BY e1.timestamp DESC;
```

#### 5. Plugin Module Resolution

**Priority: CRITICAL** 🚨

**From AGENTS.md:**
> The plugin wrapper at `~/.config/opencode/plugin/swarm.ts` must have ZERO imports from `opencode-swarm-plugin`.

**Action Items:**
1. Audit `~/.config/opencode/plugin/swarm.ts` for forbidden imports
2. Inline all logic OR use CLI spawn pattern (`spawn('swarm', ['command'])`)
3. Add CI check to prevent `import { ... } from "opencode-swarm-plugin"` in plugin wrapper

**Current error in logs:**
```
error: Cannot find module '@opencode-ai/plugin' from '/Users/joel/.config/opencode/plugin/swarm.ts'
```

This indicates the plugin wrapper is trying to import from npm scope, which breaks OpenCode context.

#### 6. Memory System Optimization

**Priority: Low**

**Current stats:**
- 8,953 memories total
- 6,659 opencode-swarm collection (session messages)
- 2,276 default collection (manual learnings)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement memory decay cleanup (remove memories with `decay_factor < 0.1`)
- Archive old session memories to separate table after 90 days
- Add memory validation workflow (flag stale/incorrect memories)

## Appendix: Sample Queries

### Find incomplete swarms
```sql
SELECT 
  json_extract(data, '$.epic_id') AS epic_id,
  json_extract(data, '$.epic_title') AS title,
  timestamp,
  datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch') AS started_at
FROM events
WHERE type = 'swarm_started'
  AND json_extract(data, '$.epic_id') NOT IN (
    SELECT json_extract(data, '$.epic_id')
    FROM events
    WHERE type IN ('swarm_completed', 'swarm_failed')
  )
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### Review outcomes by agent
```sql
SELECT 
  json_extract(dt.decision, '$.agent_name') AS reviewer,
  json_extract(e.data, '$.status') AS outcome,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM decision_traces dt
JOIN events e ON dt.outcome_event_id = e.id
WHERE dt.decision_type = 'review_decision'
GROUP BY reviewer, outcome
ORDER BY reviewer, count DESC;
```

### Strategy success rates (from eval_records)
```sql
SELECT 
  strategy,
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  SUM(CAST(overall_success AS INTEGER)) AS successes,
  ROUND(AVG(CAST(overall_success AS FLOAT)) * 100, 1) AS success_rate_pct,
  ROUND(AVG(total_duration_ms) / 1000.0, 1) AS avg_duration_sec
FROM eval_records
WHERE overall_success IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY strategy
ORDER BY success_rate_pct DESC;
```

### Top memory collections
```sql
SELECT 
  collection,
  COUNT(*) AS memory_count,
  ROUND(AVG(decay_factor), 3) AS avg_decay,
  MIN(created_at) AS oldest,
  MAX(created_at) AS newest
FROM memories
GROUP BY collection
ORDER BY memory_count DESC;
```

### Agent activity heatmap
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT project_key) AS projects,
  COUNT(*) AS registrations,
  datetime(MIN(registered_at)/1000, 'unixepoch') AS first_seen,
  datetime(MAX(last_active_at)/1000, 'unixepoch') AS last_active
FROM agents
GROUP BY name
HAVING registrations > 1
ORDER BY registrations DESC;
```

## Conclusion

The swarm database is **healthy and actively used** with strong event coverage across all system components. The event sourcing architecture is sound, decision intelligence captures rich context, and the learning system shows heavy usage.

**Critical issues:**
1. **Plugin module resolution** - MUST fix `@opencode-ai/plugin` import in wrapper (causes crashes)
2. **Compaction provider config** - `__SWARM_LITE_` provider ID is malformed

**Moderate issues:**
1. **Incomplete swarms** - 9 out of 26 swarms (35%) have no completion event
2. **Sparse eval data** - Only 5 out of 26 eval records have success metrics
3. **Strategy tracking gaps** - Strategy not consistently captured in coordinator decisions

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Fix plugin wrapper imports (critical path)
2. Investigate incomplete swarm outcomes (data quality)
3. Add compaction metrics table (observability)
4. Materialize JSON fields for query performance (optimization)

**Overall assessment:** 🟢 Production-ready with known issues tracked.
