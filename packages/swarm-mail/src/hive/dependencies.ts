/**
 * Dependency Graph Operations
 *
 * Provides dependency management with cycle detection and blocked bead tracking.
 *
 * ## Dependency Types
 * - **blocks**: Hard dependency - target must be closed before source can start
 * - **blocked-by**: Inverse of blocks (computed, not stored)
 * - **related**: Soft relationship - doesn't affect ready state
 * - **discovered-from**: Tracking relationship - found while working on another bead
 *
 * ## Cycle Prevention
 * All dependency types are checked for cycles to maintain a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
 * This ensures:
 * - Ready work calculation works correctly
 * - Dependency traversal doesn't loop
 * - Semantic clarity (no circular dependencies)
 *
 * Reference: steveyegge/beads/internal/storage/sqlite/dependencies.go
